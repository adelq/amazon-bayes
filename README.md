# Amazon Bayes Ratings - WIP

Rate Amazon products using a Bayesian algorithm instead of default average.

**Update:** This Chrome extension is now deprecated as Amazon now uses a much more sophisticated ranking algorithm by default.

> Amazon calculates a productâ€™s star ratings using a machine learned model instead of a raw data average. The machine learned model takes into account factors including: the age of a review, helpfulness votes by customers and whether the reviews are from verified purchases.
